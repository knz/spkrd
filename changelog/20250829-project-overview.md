# Project Overview Creation - 2025-08-29

## Task Specification
Create a concise project overview for the AI agent in CLAUDE.md by inspecting the current project structure, understanding the codebase, and documenting key information that would help future AI sessions understand the project context.

## High-Level Decisions
- Project is SPKRD: FreeBSD speaker device network server written in Rust
- HTTP API server that provides remote access to FreeBSD /dev/speaker device
- Uses Tokio/Axum for async HTTP server, with daemon support and syslog integration
- Includes retry logic for device concurrency and example clients in Rust/Go

## Current Status
- ✅ Task completed successfully
- ✅ Added comprehensive project overview section to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Corrected inaccurate repository structure information
- ✅ Provided technical context for future AI agent sessions

## Files Modified
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added detailed "Project Overview" section with:
  - Core purpose and functionality description
  - Technical architecture breakdown (HTTP server, device management, process management)
  - Key dependencies with their roles
  - Repository structure with file descriptions
  - Development context including platform, testing, and deployment info
  - Replaced incorrect high-level map section with accurate project-specific content

## Rationales and Alternatives
- **Comprehensive vs. Minimal**: Chose comprehensive overview to provide sufficient context for complex tasks while keeping it concise enough for quick reference
- **Structure**: Organized into logical sections (Purpose → Architecture → Dependencies → Repository → Development) for easy scanning
- **Technical Detail Level**: Balanced technical depth with accessibility - enough detail for development context, not overwhelming for general tasks
