# Audio Feedback Script Addition - 2025-08-29

## Task Specification
Add a shell script that provides audio feedback for command exit codes to the examples directory. The script acts as a prefix to other commands and uses spkrc to play different melodies based on exit status:
- Success (0): f16g16
- Interrupted (130): no sound
- Other errors (<128): o1c.
- Fatal errors (>=128): o2ec

## Requirements
1. Add script to examples/ directory with explanatory comments
2. Update examples/README to document the new script
3. Maintain existing examples structure and documentation style

## High-Level Decisions
- Script name: `spkcmd` (clear, concise name indicating speaker command wrapper)
- Executable permissions: Yes, script will be executable by default
- Documentation approach: Simple example usage, separate section in README
- Integration: Position as utility optimized for use with Rust client
- Error handling: Minimal, no additional checks for spkrc availability

## Files to be Modified
1. `examples/spkcmd` - New executable shell script with audio feedback logic
2. `examples/README.md` - Add new section documenting the utility script

## Files Modified
1. `examples/spkcmd` - Created executable shell script with comprehensive comments explaining exit code mapping and usage
2. `examples/README.md` - Added "Audio Feedback Utility" section with usage examples and requirements; updated Makefile documentation
3. `examples/Makefile` - Added spkcmd installation to install target

## Implementation Details
- Preserved original script logic exactly as provided
- Added extensive comments explaining purpose, usage, and exit code handling
- Made script executable with proper shebang
- Positioned documentation as separate utility section optimized for Rust client use
- Included practical usage examples and clear requirements

## Current Status
- ✅ Script created with executable permissions
- ✅ README updated with new utility section
- ✅ Makefile updated to install spkcmd utility
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect installation changes
- ✅ All requirements fulfilled
