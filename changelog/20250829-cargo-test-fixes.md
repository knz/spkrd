# Cargo Test Fixes - 2025-08-29

## Task Specification
Fix failing `cargo test` command in the SPKRD project.

## Current Status
COMPLETED - All cargo tests now pass successfully

## Files Modified
- tests/integration_tests.rs (updated all 4 server::run calls to include debug: false parameter)

## High-Level Decisions
- Tests should use `debug: false` since they don't need debug output during testing

## Requirements Changes
(None currently)

## Rationales and Alternatives
- Using `false` for debug parameter in tests keeps test output clean and focused
- Alternative would be `true` but that would add unnecessary verbosity to test runs

## Obstacles and Solutions
- Issue: Function signature mismatch between server::run definition and test calls
- Solution: Add `false` as 4th parameter to all test calls
