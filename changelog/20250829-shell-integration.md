# Shell Integration for Automatic spkcmd Usage - 2025-08-29

## Task Specification
Create bash and zsh configuration that automatically uses spkcmd for commands run from the command line, providing audio feedback for all command executions without requiring manual prefixing.

## Requirements
- Automatic spkcmd wrapping for command line commands
- Support for both bash and zsh shells
- Maintain normal shell functionality and behavior
- TBD: Scope and implementation approach

## High-Level Decisions
- Implementation: preexec hook approach for transparent command wrapping
- Scope: Exclude built-ins, fast commands (ls, pwd), interactive commands (vim, ssh), background jobs
- Location: Shell configuration files in examples/ directory
- Control: Toggle functions (spkcmd_on/spkcmd_off) with default active state
- Error handling: No special handling, let spkcmd fail gracefully

## Files to be Modified
1. `examples/spkcmd-bash.sh` - Bash configuration with preexec implementation
2. `examples/spkcmd-zsh.sh` - Zsh configuration with native preexec support  
3. `examples/README.md` - Add shell integration documentation section

## Files Modified
1. `examples/spkcmd-bash.sh` - Bash shell integration using function wrappers for common commands
2. `examples/spkcmd-zsh.sh` - Zsh shell integration using function wrappers and preexec hooks
3. `examples/README.md` - Added comprehensive "Shell Integration" section with installation and usage instructions

## Implementation Details
- **Function wrapper approach**: Creates wrapper functions for common external commands instead of true preexec
- **Command filtering**: Comprehensive exclusion lists for built-ins, fast commands, interactive tools, and background jobs
- **Toggle control**: `spkcmd_on`/`spkcmd_off` functions with default enabled state
- **Shell compatibility**: Separate implementations optimized for bash vs zsh differences
- **Preservation**: Zsh version preserves existing preexec functions if they exist

## Technical Decisions
- Chose function wrappers over true preexec due to implementation complexity and reliability
- Focused on common external commands that benefit most from audio feedback
- Used shell-specific array syntax and features for optimal performance
- Included comprehensive command exclusion lists to avoid audio noise

## Testing Results
- ✅ Success sound: `make --version` correctly played pleasant ascending notes
- ✅ Error sound: `make nonexistent-target` correctly played low warning tone
- ✅ Toggle off: `spkcmd_off` successfully disabled audio feedback
- ✅ Toggle on: `spkcmd_on` successfully re-enabled audio feedback
- ✅ Command filtering: `ls /tmp` correctly remained silent (excluded fast command)

## Bug Fix: Alias Conflict Resolution
**Issue**: Script failed when commands were already aliased in user's shell with errors like:
```
(eval):1: defining function based on alias `cp'
(eval):1: parse error near `()'
```

**Solution**: Enhanced wrapper creation logic to check for existing aliases:
- **Zsh**: Added `&& [[ $+aliases[$cmd] -eq 0 ]]` check
- **Bash**: Added `&& [[ $(type -t "$cmd") != "alias" ]]` check

**Testing**: Verified script loads cleanly with pre-existing aliases for cp, mv, mkdir

## Bug Fix: Preexec Recursion Issue
**Issue**: When reloading the zsh configuration, infinite recursion occurred:
```
_spkcmd_original_preexec:3: maximum nested function level reached; increase FUNCNEST?
```

**Root Cause**: Script was saving its own preexec function as the "original" on reload, creating circular calls.

**Solution**: Added recursion prevention mechanisms:
- `_SPKCMD_PREEXEC_LOADED` flag to prevent saving our own preexec as original
- `_SPKCMD_PREEXEC_ACTIVE` guard to prevent recursive calls during execution
- Proper cleanup of recursion guard in all exit paths

**Testing**: Verified script can be reloaded multiple times without recursion errors

## Enhancement: Dynamic Wrapper Creation
**Feature**: Replaced static whitelist with dynamic wrapper creation on first command execution.

**Implementation**: 
- Enhanced `preexec` hook to detect when external commands need wrapping
- `_spkcmd_needs_wrapper()` function checks if command should be wrapped (not excluded, not alias/builtin/function)
- Commands are wrapped dynamically on first execution, effective on subsequent runs
- Tracking system using `_SPKCMD_WRAPPED_COMMANDS` associative array
- Pre-seeding for common commands (make, git, cargo, etc.) for immediate availability

**Benefits**:
- No need to maintain static command lists
- Automatically wraps any external command that benefits from audio feedback
- Respects exclusion lists (builtins, fast commands, interactive tools)
- Memory efficient - only wraps commands actually used

## Current Status
- ✅ Bash shell integration created with function wrappers
- ✅ Zsh shell integration created with preexec and function wrappers  
- ✅ Documentation updated with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Full testing completed successfully with all functionality verified
- ✅ All requirements fulfilled
