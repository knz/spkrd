# Examples Directory Makefile Creation

## Task Specification
Create a Makefile in the 'examples' directory that supports three rules:
- `clean`: Remove build artifacts and temporary files
- `all`: Build all examples/components
- `install`: Install the Rust version of the client

## High-Level Decisions
- Use DSTDIR variable defaulting to /usr/local/bin for installation target
- Use system 'install' command for binary installation
- Focus only on Rust client artifacts (ignore Go client)
- Build in release mode for optimized binaries
- Clean only examples/target directory
- Assume Rust/Cargo toolchain is pre-installed

## Requirements Changes
- Clarified installation uses DSTDIR variable with /usr/local/bin default
- Confirmed scope limited to Rust client only
- Initially specified release mode builds
- Added BUILD variable to make build mode configurable (debug/release)
- Changed binary name variable from BINARY_NAME to PROGRAM
- Default binary name changed from 'client' to 'spkrc'

## Files Modified
- Created: `examples/Makefile` - Build automation with configurable variables
- Created: `examples/README.md` - Documentation for build process and usage

## Rationales and Alternatives
- Used Makefile variables with ?= operator to allow command-line overrides
- Chose 'spkrc' as default binary name (speaker client abbreviation)
- Used standard 'install' command with 755 permissions for executable
- Structured README with clear examples and configuration options
- Made BUILD variable configurable to support both debug and release builds

## Obstacles and Solutions
- None encountered - straightforward implementation

## Current Status
- Makefile created with all three targets (all, clean, install)
- README documentation completed with usage examples
- All configurable variables implemented as requested
- Task completed successfully
